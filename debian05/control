Description: Video camera capture program supporting motion detection
 Motion is a program that monitors the video signal from
 one or more cameras and is able to detect if a significant
 part of the picture has changed. Or in other words, it can
 detect motion.
 .
 The output from motion can be image files, videos or execution
 of user provided scripts.
 .
 Also, Motion has its own web server to provide output via a browser.
